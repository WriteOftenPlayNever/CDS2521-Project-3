***THE CODE WILL NOT RUN LOCALLY***

The images for the pieces are files that have to be loaded by p5js
and most browsers do not allow local html files to access the file system
because it's a security flaw

I have hosted the website on github pages and you can see it here:
https://writeoftenplaynever.github.io/CDS2521-Project-3/

That is the front end of a public github repository that you can check is identical to the files enclosed here, the code really does run just ONLY on a local server or a hosted server
